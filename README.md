### ORM-Demo
This is an attempt to build a basic version of own SQL ORM using Pytohn 3.6

It maintains the following functionality:
- Create/Delete tables
- Insert/update
- SELECT *columns
- Raise of basic type errors:
  - Table does not exist
  - Column does not exist
  - Required Value is not specified
- Foreign Keys
- Auto-join
